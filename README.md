# End-to-End Image Classification with CNNs, Transfer Learning & Optuna

This project demonstrates a complete image classification workflow using PyTorch on the Intel Image Classification dataset.

## Highlights
- Custom CNN built from scratch
- Transfer learning with pretrained backbones
- Data augmentation for improved generalization
- Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna
- Final evaluation with confusion matrix and error analysis

## Tech Stack
- PyTorch
- Optuna
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Kaggle (training environment)

## Results
- Strong generalization on unseen test data
- Most errors occur between visually similar scene categories

# Full experiments and visualizations are available in the notebook.
